## LFI / RFI - Local / Remote File Inclusions:

* LFI and RFI stands for Local File Inclusion meanwhile RFI stands for Remote File Inclusion ..
* One of the most well known exploit before was in PHP - Move_Uploaded_File which is an example of RFI ..
* It is a File Handling Exploit or Attack which could penetrate into your Target host via Uploads ..
* I will focus more on HTTP Attacks nowadays like HTTP/1.0 vulnerability which is found on HTTP Path ..
